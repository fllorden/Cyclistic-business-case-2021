Final deliverables for the Cyclistic (Divvy bike) case, part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate

Step 1 - Ask:
Understand how annual members and casual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual members into annual members.

Step 2 - Prepare:
The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

It was organized by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation. There were some anomalies in the data (these are highlighted in the Cyclistic - Annual Members vs Casual Members.pptx file.

Step 3 - Process:
After importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. A new column for ride length (in minutes) was created. Any data I was uncertain about was marked for exclusion from the final dataset. A full description of the process is described [here](https://github.com/fllorden/Cyclistic-business-case-2021/commit/024af9285a8c83c5546dcff1343675dbe99bc74a).

Step 4 - Analyze:
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualizations.

Step 5 - Share:
Visualizations were created using Tableau. Published [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/FedericoLlorden/Sheet1?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and included in the PowerPoint presentation.

Step 6 - Act:
A PowerPoint presentation was compiled in Cyclistic - Annual Members vs Casual Members.pptx, offering recommendations and next steps.
